#scrollReveal.js
####Declarative on-scroll reveal animations.
A simple way to create and maintain how elements fade in, triggered when they enter the viewport. An open-source experiment by [@JulianLloyd](https://twitter.com/julianlloyd)
***
##[See Demo](http://julianlloyd.me/scrollreveal)
***
> **Disclaimer:** Please bear in mind that this plug-in is an experimental stage, and that breaking changes are virtually guaranteed in future updates.

##1. Installation
Clone or download download `scrollReveal.js` into your JavaScript folder, and reference it just before the closing `</body>` tag. It will automatically instantiate ready-to-go when the `DOMContentReady` event fires.


```
    // Everything else
    // ...

    <script src="js/scrollReveal.js"></script>
</body>
```

>**NOTE:** scrollReveal.js does not require jQuery, but *does* rely upon CSS3 transitions; it has been developed exclusively for modern browser use only.


##2. Usage
By adding a `data-scrollreveal` attribute to an element, it will automatically be revealed (using default values) as soon as the element is within the viewport.<br><br> **Fig 1**:

```
<h1 data-scrollreveal> Hello world! </h1>
```
However, scrollReveal.js allows you to define custom reveal behavior, using *descriptive language*. <br><br>**Fig 2**:
```
<h1 data-scrollreveal="enter from the top and move 50px over 1.33s"> Foo </h1>

<p data-scrollreveal="move 66px and enter from the bottom after 1s"> Bar </p>

<button data-scrollreveal="enter from the bottom over 1.1s but wait 2.5s"> Baz </button>
```



###2.1 Keywords, Values and Fillers
Whatever string is passed to the `data-scrollreveal` attribute is parsed for specific words: **keywords** that expect to be followed by a **value**, and semantic **fillers** that facilitate more natural language.

####2.1.1 Keywords and Values
These words describe the reveal behavior, using **keyword** / **value** pairs.

---

- **Enter** — Controls the direction of your element transition. Whatever value is passed is considered the vector origin. For example, specifying `top` will reveal your element with a downward motion.
  * Accepted value: `top`, `right`, `bottom` or `left` → (eg. `enter top`)

---

- **Move** — The distance your element will travel during transition.
 * Accepted value: **[ integer ] px** → (eg. `move 33px`)

---

- **Over** — The duration of your element’s transition.
 * Accepted value: **[ decimal ] s** → (eg. `over 1.66s`)

---

- **After/Wait** — The delay before your element beings its transition.
 * Accepted value: **[ decimal ] s** → (eg. `after 0.33s` or `wait 0.33s`)

---

#### 2.1.2 Fillers
While **keywords** must be followed by an appropriate accepted **value**, the use of conjoining **fillers** are permitted for more readable language. These are shown below:

- `from`
- `the`
- `and`
- `then`
- `but`

**Fig 3**:
```
<!-- Eg. 3.1 — These 2 lines are equivalent -->
<div data-scrollreveal="enter top move 25px"> Example 1 </div>
<div data-scrollreveal="enter from the top and then move 25px"> Example 1 </div>

<!-- Eg. 3.2 — These 3 lines are equivalent -->
<div data-scrollreveal="enter left move 80px over 0.66s but then wait 3s"> Example 2 </div>
<div data-scrollreveal="over 0.66s move 80px but wait 3s and enter from the left"> Example 2 </div>
<div data-scrollreveal="after 3s, enter left and move 80px over 0.66s"> Example 2 </div>
```

### 3. Contributions / Thanks!
I noticed a growing number of clients were requesting on-scroll CSS3 transitions for various site elements, and so scrollReveal.js was made to help with development. If you’d like to contribute—please do!
